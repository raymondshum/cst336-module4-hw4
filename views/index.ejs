          <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><br />

          <p>
            The purpose of this website is to explore topics related to Bitcoin: it’s background, economic or environmental impacts, and potential solutions to these issues. You can navigate through this discussion by either using the “Content” drop down menu on the navigation bar or by following the links at the bottom of each page.

          <h2><strong>What is Bitcoin?</strong></h2><br />

          <p>
            Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person using the alias, “Satoshi Nakamoto”. It is regarded as the first major cryptocurrency – a digital currencies secured by cryptographic techniques. Bitcoin is secured through a distributed digital record known as a blockchain. The blockchain is a decentralized store of transactions, a piece of which is held by every participating user. Decentralization means that no one organization maintains control of all the records. Additionally, the records are publicly accessible meaning that individuals can audit the data. In fact, transactions must by verified by the majority of blockchain participants before they are added. 
          </p><br />

          <h2><strong>How are they made?</strong></h2><br />

          <p>
            Bitcoins are “produced” (or more accurately, discovered) through a process called mining, which is performed by solving a cryptographic calculation that is hard to generate but easy to verify. Bitcoin was developed with a maximum number of coins in mind (21 million). Thus, Bitcoin mining has become progressively difficult over time, requiring more time and energy to discover new coins. 
          </p><br />

          <h2><strong>How does Bitcoin relate to Computer Science?</strong></h2><br />

          <p>
            The way Bitcoin was implemented and deployed relates to the field of Computer Science. Examples include the use of a blockchain algorithm in verifying transactions and the cryptographic algorithm responsible for mining. However, this website focuses on the societal impact of Bitcoin rather than the technical aspects. As students, technical knowledge is important in building a foundation on which we can develop our ability to solve problems. However, I feel that as future developers, we should also try to understand how our work can affect the world once it leaves our hands.
