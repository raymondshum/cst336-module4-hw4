        <h2><strong>What is the economic appeal of bitcoin?</strong></h2><br />
          <p>
            Bitcoin is a denationalized currency – it is not bound by the economy of a single government, region, or entity. It is thought to be a mix between a traditional currency and a commodity (such as gold), possessing the desirable traits of durability, divisibility, portability, high liquidity, and low transaction costs. For some, it represents the prototype for a global currency and for others, its volatility provides appeal as a speculative asset.

        <h2><strong>How has Bitcoin integrated with the global economy?</strong></h2><br />
          <p>
            According to a study published by the IEEE, there were 18.42 million Bitcoins in circulation in 2020, showing a logarithmic increase since its inception in 2009. Bitcoin has gradually gained acceptance from around 1000 vendors in 2012, 75,000 businesses in 2014 and 36% of small and medium sized businesses in the US as of 2020. This includes some major companies such as Microsoft, Burger-King, AT&T, KFC, Reddit, Dell, Target and Paypal.

        <h2><strong>What economic challenges does Bitcoin face?</strong></h2><br />
          <p>
           As a decentralized currency, Bitcoin is regulated inconsistently by different organizations. For example, The US classifies it as a commodity and taxes it as such. On the other hand, China sees it as a competitor to its own digital Yuan and places heavy restrictions on its usage. The variance in local regulation and enforcement lead to suppressive effects on trading and result in price differences across jurisdictions. One of Bitcoin’s primary attributes is its ability to act as an international currency. It’s ability to cross borders and its use in anonymous transactions has been used for tax evasion, illicit activities and to avoid regulation by local governments. It is highly likely that local financial institutions will continue to increase regulatory efforts towards Bitcoin as it gains further adoption.
