    <p>
      innovaTree is a fictional organization of which I am a member. My team
      created this group as part of another course, CST 300: Major Proseminar.
      One of the principles of this group is to provide green solutions for
      technical issues. I thought it would be great to follow in this trend by
      providing an environmental perspective on Bitcoin, a topic that is
      normally considered through an economic or technical lens.
